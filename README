==================
stm32f103_template
==================

This project is a rather minimal template for developing small applications
for STM32F103 processor.

Only active drivers for now are
- UART1 driver
- LED @PC13 driver

A simple timer providing micros() and millis() counted from boot is provided.

Makefile has additional targets for flashing and debugging
  flashn - flash using stm32loader (and do not send R to enter bootloader)
  flash  - as above but sends 'R' to enter bootloader, template code will
           wait for R for 2 seconds after boot
  stlink - flash using stlinkv2, needs openocd installed
  gdb    - compile with debuginfo, flash with stlinkv2 and start gdb thru stlink

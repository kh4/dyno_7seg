=====================================================
stm32f103 based dual display with difference for Dyno
=====================================================

ADC samples pins A0 and A1 and shows the results on a
7 segment LED display attached to GPIO pins, see drv_7seg.c for
display details.

Makefile has additional targets for flashing and debugging
  flashn - flash using stm32loader (and do not send R to enter bootloader)
  flash  - as above but sends 'R' to enter bootloader, template code will
           wait for R for 2 seconds after boot
  stlink - flash using stlinkv2, needs openocd installed
  gdb    - compile with debuginfo, flash with stlinkv2 and start gdb thru stlink
